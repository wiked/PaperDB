What new hell is this?
----------------------

Paperdb is a distributed [NoSQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) database engine.  Paperdb files can be spread across many drives, computers, and networks.

Paperdb is oriented for applications needing very fast input and limited search capability.

So, is it Paperdb or paperdb?
-----------------------------

The name of the application and repository is paperdb.  It only gets capitalized in the beginning of sentences, like other nouns in the English language.  If you're writing *auf Deutche* feel free to capitalize "Der Paperdb".  German is kind of odd like.
